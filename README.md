## üîß How This Works

This repository is automatically generated using a Python script that:

1. **Logs into LeetCode** using Selenium WebDriver
2. **Scrapes all submissions** from the submissions pages
3. **Filters accepted solutions** and removes duplicates
4. **Fetches problem details** using LeetCode's GraphQL API
5. **Generates solution files** with proper formatting
6. **Uploads everything to GitHub** using the GitHub API

## üöÄ Usage

1. Browse problems in the table above
2. Click on problem titles to view them on LeetCode
3. Click on solution links to view my code
4. Each solution includes problem information and the accepted code

## üìà Progress Tracking

- **Current Streak:** Continuously solving problems
- **Focus Areas:** Data Structures, Algorithms, Problem Solving
- **Next Goal:** Reach 100 problems solved!
